   1. Conditional statements  are used to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions. These statements allow the program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. The primary conditional statements in Java include:

### 1. `if` Statement:

**Definition:**
The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

**Syntax:**
```java
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

### 2. `if-else` Statement:

**Definition:**
The `if-else` statement is used to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

**Syntax:**
```java
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

### 3. `if-else if-else` Statement:

**Definition:**
The `if-else if-else` statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence. It executes the first block of code whose condition is true.

**Syntax:**
```java
if (condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if none of the conditions is true
}
```

### Control and Jump Statements:
1. **Definition:**
   Control statements in Java are used to manage the flow of execution in a program. They include decision-making statements 

   *Looping Statements:*
    *For Loop*: Repeats a block of code a specific number of times.
     

   *Jump Statements:*
    *Break Statement:* Terminates the innermost loop or switch statement.
    *Continue Statement:* Skips the current iteration and continues to the loop and proceeds to the next iteration.
